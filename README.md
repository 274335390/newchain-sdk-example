## Workflow

Work via Gitlab as much as possible!

* If there is a problem or bug, raise an issue on GitLab.
* Don't ask if your work is okay - commit it, make a merge request, and THEN ask your team to check.
* But if you have a big question, ask *before* you start working on the problem. It's best to be clear early on for the big picture. Little details can be fixed later if needed.
