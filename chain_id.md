# NewChain IDs for Different Environments

| Environment | Chain ID | String in NEW Address |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MainNet | 1012 | 182 |
| TestNet | 1007 | 17z |
| BetaNet | 1007 | 17z |
| DevNet | 1002 | 17x |

Since the chain ID is different in different environments, we can identify the environment of a NEW address based on the specific part of string in the NEW address which is created from the chain ID.
